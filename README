This code provides PLT Scheme bindings to the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).  It is based off Will Farr's mzgsl.plt package. All code is released under the GPL licence, following GSL.

The code in low-level contains the actual bindings to GSL. The code in the top-level directory contains the cleaner interface built on top of them.
